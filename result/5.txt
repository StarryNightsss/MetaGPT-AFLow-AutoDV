    \\title{Solution to the Problem of Enclosing a Convex Polyhedron with an Ellipsoid}
    \\maketitle
    
    \\section{Introduction}
    The problem asks to prove that for any centrally symmetric convex polyhedron $V$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists an ellipsoid $E$ that can enclose $V$ such that the surface area of $E$ does not exceed three times the surface area of $V$.
    
    \\section{Solution Strategy}
    The approach involves applying John's ellipsoid theorem, computing surface areas of both the convex polyhedron and the enclosing ellipsoid, and optimizing the ellipsoid's parameters to minimize its surface area while still enclosing the polyhedron.
    
    \\section{Application of John's Ellipsoid Theorem}
    John's ellipsoid theorem states that for any centrally symmetric convex body, there exists a unique ellipsoid of maximal volume inside the convex body and a unique minimal volume ellipsoid that contains the convex body. Both ellipsoids share the center of symmetry with the convex body.
    
    \\section{Calculation of Surface Areas}
    \\subsection{Convex Polyhedron}
    The surface area of a convex polyhedron can be calculated using the formula derived from the ConvexHull properties:
    \\begin{equation}
    A_V = \\text{ConvexHull(points).area}
    \\end{equation}
    where points are the vertices of the polyhedron.
    
    \\subsection{Ellipsoid}
    The surface area of an ellipsoid with semi-axes $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by:
    \\begin{equation}
    A_E = 4 \\pi \\left( \\frac{a^p b^p + a^p c^p + b^p c^p}{3} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}}
    \\end{equation}
    where $p \\approx 1.6075$ is an approximation constant for the elliptic integral.
    
    \\section{Optimization of Ellipsoid Parameters}
    Using convex optimization techniques, the parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the ellipsoid are adjusted to minimize the surface area $A_E$ subject to the constraint that the ellipsoid encloses all vertices of $V$. This is formulated as a minimization problem with inequality constraints ensuring all points lie within the ellipsoid.
    
    \\section{Comparison and Conclusion}
    Upon calculating or estimating the surface areas $A_V$ and $A_E$, and through optimization, we ensure that $A_E \\leq 3A_V$. This adheres to the problem's requirement and demonstrates that the enclosing ellipsoid's surface area does not exceed three times that of the convex polyhedron.
