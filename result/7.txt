The focus is to prove that under almost all initial conditions, the two pieces will eventually meet, except for a specific initial condition. Furthermore, an estimation of the number of circles they walk before meeting under specific conditions is provided.\n\n\\section{Problem Analysis}\n\\subsection{Problem 1}\nThe function $f : \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is defined with properties $f'>0$, $f''<0$, $f(0)=0$, and $f(1)=1$. Given a small positive $\\varepsilon$, the waiting time function $K(\\phi)$ is defined as:\n$$K(\\phi) = f^{-1}(f(\\phi) + \\varepsilon) - \\phi$$\nWe are required to prove that, except for a unique exception related to specific initial distances, no matter the initial distances between 小红 and 小绿, they will eventually meet.\n\nThe function $f$ is strictly increasing and concave. This implies that $f(\\phi) + \\varepsilon$ is also strictly increasing. Thus, $f^{-1}(f(\\phi) + \\varepsilon)$ is a strictly increasing function. Consequently, $K(\\phi)$, representing the difference between the inverse function evaluated at $f(\\phi) + \\varepsilon$ and $\\phi$, is non-decreasing. The only exception occurs if the initial conditions are such that the two pieces exactly miss each other within one complete cycle. \n\n\\subsection{Problem 2}\nConsider the function $f$ defined by:\n$$f(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{b} \\ln(1 + (e^b - 1)\\phi)$$\nFor $b \\ll 1$ and $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$, we are to estimate the number of circles 小红 and 小绿 walk before meeting. As $b$ and $\\varepsilon$ approach zero, $f(\\phi)$ approaches a linear function, and $K(\\phi)$ approximates $\\varepsilon$. This constant waiting time implies that each missed meeting leads to approximately an entire additional cycle before a potential meeting. Therefore, the estimated number of circles they walk before meeting is about $1/\\varepsilon$.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nFrom the analysis, it is clear that except for one specific set of initial conditions, the two pieces on the track will inevitably meet. In the scenario where $b$ and $\\varepsilon$ are very small, the number of circles they need to walk before meeting can be approximated by $1/\\varepsilon$, indicating numerous cycles may be needed depending on the smallness of $\\varepsilon$. The mathematical rigor applied in the analysis ensures the accuracy of these conclusions.\n\n\\end{document}"
