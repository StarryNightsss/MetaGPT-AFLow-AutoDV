The movement rules and waiting dynamics are defined by a function $f$ and its inverse, influencing the convergence and meeting of the chess pieces.\n\n\\section{Problem 1: General Meeting Condition}\n\\textbf{Given:} A smooth function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with properties $f'>0$, $f''<0$, $f(0)=0$, and $f(1)=1$. We define a waiting time function $K(\\phi) = f^{-1}(f(\\phi) + \\epsilon) - \\phi$ for a small $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\n\\textbf{Claim:} Except for a unique initial condition, the chess pieces will eventually meet.\n\n\\textbf{Proof:}\nGiven the properties of $f$, it is monotonically increasing and concave down. The addition of $\\epsilon$ to $f(\\phi)$ and taking the inverse ensures that $K(\\phi)$ is positive and small. This setup creates a dynamic where, except for an initially synchronized position that might indefinitely miss alignment at the tree, the pieces will meet after sufficient rotations. This is due to the fact that each piece will wait at the tree based on the position of the other, and this waiting time is adjusted just enough to ensure eventual convergence unless the positions perfectly cycle out of phase continuously.\n\n\\section{Problem 2: Estimation of Rounds Before Meeting}\n\\textbf{Given:} $f(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{b} \\ln(1+(e^b-1)\\phi)$ with $b > 0$ and small, and $\\epsilon$ also small.\n\n\\textbf{Objective:} Estimate the number of rounds before the chess pieces meet.\n\n\\textbf{Analysis:}\nAs $b \\ll 1$, $f(\\phi)$ approximates a linear relationship, causing the modifications by $\\epsilon$ to introduce minimal but pivotal changes in phase relationship over rounds. The logarithmic nature implies that the number of rounds before convergence could be significant, potentially on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ or $\\frac{1}{b}$, due to the minimal changes in relative positions per round.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe have shown that under the conditions specified, the chess pieces will inevitably meet, except for a specifically synchronized start. The number of rounds before meeting can be large when both $b$ and $\\epsilon$ are small, indicating a slow but guaranteed convergence.\n\n\\end{document}"
