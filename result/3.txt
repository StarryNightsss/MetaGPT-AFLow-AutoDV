The matrix $A$ is a $2 \\times 2$ integer matrix with non-zero determinant. Two scenarios are considered based on the trace and irreducibility of the characteristic polynomial of $A$.\n\n\\section{Theoretical Background}\n\\subsection{Definitions}\nA subset $\\Gamma$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is called $T$-dense if for every vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, there exists a vector $w \\in \\Gamma$ such that the Euclidean distance $\\|v-w\\| \\leqslant T$. A transformation by a matrix $A$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ maps vectors via $A \\cdot v$. The determinant of $A$, denoted $\\det(A)$, represents the area scaling factor, and the trace, $\\mathrm{tr}(A)$, influences the eigenvalues of $A$.\n\n\\subsection{Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem}\nIn $\\mathbb{R}^2$, any convex symmetric body around the origin with an area greater than 4 contains at least one non-zero lattice point. This theorem is crucial for establishing the density of lattice points in Euclidean space under linear transformations.\n\n\\section{Problem Analysis and Solution}\n\\subsection{Problem 1: $\\mathrm{tr}(A) = 0$}\nGiven $\\mathrm{tr}(A) = 0$, the eigenvalues of $A$ are likely opposites. As $A$ is similar to a rotation-scaling matrix, $A^n$ affects the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ by rotating and scaling. The density of $A^n\\mathbb{Z}^2$ can be inferred from the growth of $|\\det(A^n)| = |\\det(A)|^n$, and by applying Minkowski's theorem, we conclude there exists $C > 0$ such that $A^n\\mathbb{Z}^2$ is $C |\\det(A)|^{n/2}$-dense.\n\n\\subsection{Problem 2: Irreducible Characteristic Polynomial}\nIf the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, $A$ has complex or non-rational eigenvalues, implying a non-trivial rotational component in its powers. The argument follows similarly to Problem 1, utilizing $\\det(A)$ and Minkowski's theorem to establish the $T$-density for $A^n\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nFor both cases, there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that for any positive integer $n$, the set $A^n \\mathbb{Z}^2$ is $C|\\det(A)|^{n/2}$-dense in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This conclusion aligns with the properties of matrix transformations and the application of Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem.\n\n\\end{document}"
