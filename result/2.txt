    "To maximize the expected cumulative score when points are retained even if shot down, we analyze the situation where Ming continuously shoots down enemy planes until he chooses to stop, gaining points each time. The points decrease linearly over time at a rate of 1 point per unit time and increase by 1.5 points each time an enemy is shot down. The probability of shooting down the nth enemy plane is (0.85)^n. \\\\"
    "The expectation of points after shooting down each successive enemy is calculated as follows: \\\\"
    "- Initial points = 2 \\\\"
    "- After 1st enemy: Points = 2 + 1.5 - 1 = 2.5 \\\\"
    "- After 2nd enemy: Points = 2.5 + 1.5 \\times 0.85 - 1 = 3.775 \\\\"
    "- After 3rd enemy: Points = 3.775 + 1.5 \\times (0.85)^2 - 1 = 4.60625 \\\\"
    "- After 4th enemy: Points = 4.60625 + 1.5 \\times (0.85)^3 - 1 = 5.0653125 \\\\"
    "The optimal strategy to maximize expected points is to stop after shooting down the 4th enemy plane, as the expected points are highest at this stage. \\\\"

    "\\textbf{{Problem (2):}} \\\\"
    "In the scenario where points reset to zero if Ming is shot down, we need to consider the risk associated with continuing the game. The expected score calculations must account for this risk by including the probability of being shot down, which increases with each enemy due to the decreasing probability of shooting them down. \\\\"
    "Calculations show that the expected score reaches a peak and then starts to decline due to the increasing risk of losing all points. After detailed computations, the optimal point to stop, to balance between high score and risk, is found to be after shooting down two enemy planes. \\\\"
