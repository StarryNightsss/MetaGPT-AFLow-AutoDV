The score decreases linearly over time at a rate of 1 per unit time. Enemy aircraft appear at intervals that follow an exponential distribution with a mean of 1. Each encounter with an enemy aircraft results in either shooting down the enemy or being shot down. If the player shoots down the enemy, they gain 1.5 points and can decide to continue or exit the game. The probability of shooting down the nth enemy decreases as $(0.85)^n$. The game ends either by being shot down, deciding to exit, or the score reaching zero.\n\n\\section{Solution}\n\\subsection{Optimal Stopping Strategy Without Score Reset}\nThe objective is to maximize the expected cumulative score. The score evolution as the player decides to either shoot down or stop after each enemy plane is given by:\n\\begin{align*}\nE_n &= 2 + 1.5n - n, \\\nP(\\text{shooting down } k \\text{ planes}) &= (0.85)^k, \\\nE(\\text{score}) &= (2 + 1.5k - k) \\times (0.85)^k.\n\\end{align*}\nCalculating for $k = 1, 2, 3, 4$ gives the following results:\n\\begin{align*}\nk = 1, & \\quad E(\\text{score}) = 3.5 \\times 0.85 = 2.975, \\\nk = 2, & \\quad E(\\text{score}) = 5 \\times 0.7225 = 3.6125, \\\nk = 3, & \\quad E(\\text{score}) = 6.5 \\times 0.614125 = 3.9918125, \\\nk = 4, & \\quad E(\\text{score}) = 8 \\times 0.52200625 = 4.17605.\n\\end{align*}\nFrom the calculations, the optimal stopping point without the score reset is after 4 planes, as it yields the highest expected score.\n\n\\subsection{Optimal Stopping Strategy With Score Reset}\nWhen the score resets to zero upon being shot down, the expected score changes significantly. The calculations for $k = 1, 2, 3, 4$ with reset condition are:\n\\begin{align*}\nk = 1, & \\quad E(\\text{score}) = 3.5 \\times 0.85 = 2.975, \\\nk = 2, & \\quad E(\\text{score}) = 5 \\times 0.7225 = 3.6125, \\\nk = 3, & \\quad E(\\text{score}) = 6.5 \\times 0.614125 = 3.9918125, \\\nk = 4, & \\quad E(\\text{score}) = 8 \\times 0.52200625 = 4.17605.\n\\end{align*}\nSimilarly, the optimal stopping point with score reset remains after shooting down 4 planes.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn both scenarios, the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected score is to stop after shooting down 4 enemy planes, irrespective of the score reset condition.\n\n\\end{document}"
